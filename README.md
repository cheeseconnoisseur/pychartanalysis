# pychartanalysis
long term project with the end goal of using machine learning on forex Data

Having stuffed my head with as much as I could learn on Machine Learning I now want to acctually try somewthing with it
so far ive made a pytho script that using linear regression from the sckit learn module can predict stocks with okayish accuracy 
e.g. predicting 30 days into the future has an accuracy of 84%.

I would like to now apply this to forex data which should be a similar concept and probably give similar results, later on i wuld like
to experiment with running this data, as well as headlines to give common sentiments of the country the currency corresponds to,
through simple deep neural networks, and then maybe experiment with an rnn or a combination of the two, using tensorflow.
